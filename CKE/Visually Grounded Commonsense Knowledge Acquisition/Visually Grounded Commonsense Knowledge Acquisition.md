# Main idea

**Commonsense knowledge extraction (CKE)**
	which aims to extract plausible commonsense interactions between entities

CKE is a **Distantly Supervised multi-instance learning problem**
	Contrastive Instance Learning (CIL)

# Model

## CLEVER
![[Pasted image 20241010184652.png#pic_center]]

It formulates CKE as a distantly supervised multi-instance learning problem 
	Models learn to summarize general commonsense relations of an entity pair from a bag of images.

- What is Distant Supervision (DS) learning?
	It is one method in Semi-supervised learning domain. The main idea is to automatically generate labeled training data through existing knowledge database. 

- What is the problem and possible solutions of DS learning?
	Problem: Noise
	Description: The synthesized label may not absolutely correct.
	Solutions:
		Multi-instance learning (MIL)
			Contrastive Instance Learning (CIL)
		Attention mechanism
### Data process

- What is bag? What is instance? What is the goal of multi-instance learning (MIL)?
	Bag is a container including many instances. Instance is like an image or a sentence.
	Each bag has a label, which indicates the main property of most of the instances in the bag. While instances don't have label.
	The goal of MIL is to predict the label of each bag through the unlabeled instances in it.

**Bag labels** are automatically created through existing knowledge databases(KBs).

### Training
#### Vision-language pre-training (VLP) models

Goal
	To understand the semantic interactions in each image of the bag, 
	then to extract commonsense facts about a pair of query entities 
#### Contrastive attention mechanism model

Goal
	To select informative pair of query entities,
	to select meaningful images,
	so that to summarize bag-level commonsense relations
